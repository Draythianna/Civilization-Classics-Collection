# Civilization-Classics-Collection
Civilization Classic Collection Extractor and Installer Sid Meier's Civilization 1 through Civilization II: Test of Time

While I easily could have just released a basic installer, to keep legality this one uses images, archives or actual original cdroms and is very comprehensive. While a lot of the modern fixes work was done by many other talented modders, they will be credited (incoming).

To give you the scope of this project there were an agonizing 8224 lines of code, 394 files, 42 folders, and 300 MB of data. It includes a scripted Indeo Fix, 64bit fixes, the Civ2 UI Additions, Civ2 Music fix, Test of Time Patch Project, the Test of Time official addon scenario "Time Threat Paradox", multiple fixes and choices after the original patches are applied. And backs up critical files. This is a WIP. The installer would have been only 30mb had I not included the extras and documentations, so feedback on that or whatever else is welcome, bring it up in Issues.

# This Collection Includes:

Sid Meier's Civilization

Sid Meier's CivNet

Sid Meier's Civilization Multiplayer Gold Edition

Sid Meier's Civilization Test of Time

# Installer Walkthrough (with Pictures)

In order to use this installer you will need archives, disc image files, or it should work with the actual discs if your computer can attach a disc drive, Something like this works:

After a Couple of Prompts to extract temporary files it will bring this lovely powershell window up, select yes or video will crash all 4 games:

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be7b7202-631b-4271-bf00-d536ac57c5a4" width="400">

Next it will detect what kind of computer Architecture you are using and apply the appropriate Indeo Video Fix, most people now use x64

Next is the installer main menu:

Fancy looking no?  Next accept the license or you aren't getting anywhere! (CC BY-NC-SA)

Terms basically are:

 BY: credit must be given to the creator(s).

Next main installer options (these may change slightly on newer versions):

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02abfd9c-baeb-4619-8441-9bdf3cfb6e56" width="400">

*note you'll have to scroll to select all the options you want*

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0a473b5-9b71-4fa1-8959-7e0dcf90d96a" width="400">
 
Depending on your options you'll see the next set of screen repeated for each game:

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faa786e4-1a7f-494d-875b-fd28689b6164" width="400">

When you are done selecting all the formats you will be greeted by repeated screens like this for each game:

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c839d1ff-7b3b-4939-b5c1-a2d8a50a46ea" width="400">

*some are different types of installs*

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb921e19-05f7-4670-87a0-fbea5f514306" width="400">

While you can ignore this step, note only Civilization II and Test of Time will work without the 16bit compatibility layer:

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d3b2fc5-77f6-42b9-9dd1-4818ba72110e" width="400">

*If you pick the old 16 bit Civilization Games, 1 and CivNET, these are the recommended choices:

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9c901bf-6da8-4305-92cd-b780103942ed" width="400">
 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28facae2-e7c7-458f-a31d-4fc74287b3b6" width="400">
 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/895a0885-8673-4fdc-981f-4e5585c85f71" width="400">
 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50e1aa5c-1f47-4d78-bcc4-3c67c54b7583" width="400">
 
Once this is done the setup will install the common files, and then run a bunch command scripts looking like these (ignore errors unless something doesn't work):

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a0ca2a5-b77e-483e-9204-1825e6845195" width="400">
 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea0690bc-63f2-48ec-9f76-ff7c15baeeca" width="400">
 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36e8d1dd-1186-49ca-abb7-1a4b66988311" width="400">

and last some powershell commands:

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19d29d12-f722-4255-bf23-cc5a0b8b75d1" width="400">

finishes up with converting the music to usable formats:

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60094798-8e02-4c22-9d67-e0d10e2fb409" width="400">

If you choose it it will install the patches and modern fixes:

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7caa5dd7-e298-43e3-948d-2fffa35b6939" width="400">

Lastly the optional extras, including pdf docs and non duplicated original mod author files:

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca923255-cab9-4870-a694-0dcf2afc745f" width="400">

Installer will quit, and you are ready to play, using shortcuts on your desktop or start menu!
